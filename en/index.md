**Welcome to my personal webpage**,

I am a researcher specializing in econometrics, environmental and natural resource economics, and finance. I hold a PhD in Economics from the University of Orléans and am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, where I work on modeling interactions between industrial activities and biodiversity and ecosystem services within the *Biodiversity Under Global Stress* research unit. I am also a guest researcher at the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and an associate researcher at the Laboratoire d’Économie d’Orléans.

My research aims to better understand how industrial activities and capital accumulation dynamics are influenced by the major ecological challenges of our time, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and the depletion of natural resources. My research methodology is built on two pillars. The first consists of developing science-based methods to measure environmental factors—such as environmental impacts, physical dependencies on ecosystems, or exposure to public policies—related to firms’ production activities, in a transparent, reliable, and harmonized manner. The second pillar involves integrating these factors into econometric models of economic and financial variables, such as asset price volatility or capital investment.

My research approach is interdisciplinary and inspired by various fields within environmental sciences, such as industrial ecology. My most recent work integrates natural capital accounting methods, Earth observation data, and geolocated physical assets in an effort to better measure nature-related risks at a global scale. I am also an expert in statistical modeling applied to various types of socioeconomic and financial data, including causal inference methods and predictive modeling, as well as in the integration of geospatial data (including geospatial operations on global maps).
